		<h1>Basics</h1>

		<p>
			This application can be used to set up interactive cinematic VR experiences. A project consists of a variable number of scenes
			which contain interactive buttons. Each scene is associated with a video, which should be an equirectangular projection
			of a sphere. The video may be stereoscopic (stacked either vertically or horizontally).
		</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Resources</h2>

			In the resources section videos can be uploaded, selected for editing or deleted. Videos are stored on the application server
			and are not linked with the project. Due to the large size of videos it would create a significant overhead to always
			transfer them upon loading or saving.
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Project</h2>

			<p>
				The project section displays the current project tree, consisting of scenes and their buttons, affordances and settings.
				Objects can be added or removed as necessary.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a project is saved using "Save" from the file menu, it is stored in the browser. Use "Save As" to store it as a file
				on disk.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Properties</h2>

			In the properties sidebar the selected item can be inspected and edited. The types of properties that are available depends
			on the selected item. Most items have a name which determines how they are displayed in the project tree.
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Modes</h2>

			<p>
				In the middle section of the editor there are two buttons that change the mode of the editor. In edit mode (
				<mat-icon>mode_edit</mat-icon>) scenes are displayed on a plane and scene elements can be manipulated. In view mode (
				<mat-icon>play_arrow</mat-icon>) the scene is displayed in a 360-degree environment.
			</p>
		</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Scene Editor</h1>

		<p>
			In the scene editor (available in edit mode when a scene or one of its elements is selected) elements belonging to a scene
			can be manipulated.
		</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Buttons</h2>

			<p>
				Buttons can be positioned by clicking and dragging them. To resize a button, hold
				<span class="key">Shift</span> while dragging it. To select a button, double click it.
			</p>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Affordances</h1>

		<p>
			In the context of this application an affordance is something that communicates interactivity or interaction opportunities
			to the user. Affordances are global to the project and affect how scenes are rendered in the viewer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The checkbox next to an affordance in the project explorer can be used to quickly enable or disable a given affordance. This
			has the same effect as changing the
			<span class="prop">Enabled</span> property in the properties editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			The order in which the affordances are applied matters. Affordances are applied top to bottom and their order can be changed
			by dragging the items in the list.
		</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Types</h2>

			<p>There are various types of affordances that can be added to a project. This section lists and explains them.</p>

			<p>
				The viewer has two primary parts: The video sphere and an orthographic HUD on top of that. Affordances are labeled accordingly
				to indicate which layers are affected. Affordances that are rendered to the sphere tend to move around as the camera
				changes while those on the HUD are more static.
